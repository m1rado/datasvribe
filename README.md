I haven’t fully integrated loadouts into the database and so you’ll have to put a “1” for any rows you want included in calculations into the "loadout" column and then the qty of weapon firing into the qty column, and then the total damage column will show you how many hits the detachment in column A should expect from that qty of the loadout =1 weapons

I added some default weapon loadouts but stopped short of knights and titans.

Play around, have fun!
